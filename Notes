Created a python package called 'Website'.





Flask: an easy to use web application, and easy to use framework within python. I will be using flask to create the website. 

# setting up flask
from flask import Flask

def create_app():
    app = Flask(__name__)
    # __name__ holds the name of the file being ran.

# secure cookies and session data related to the website. String 'secretkey' is the secret key for our app
app.config['SECRET_KEY'] = 'secretkey'
