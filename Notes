creating Website with Anvil

Anvil is a website that allows us to create a E commerce website using pyhton code more easily.

Anvil allows us to use a drag and drop editor that allows us to create out custom HTML

HTML: is code that is used to structure a web page.

Anvil has a propertys tab that allows us to change the name of stuff, its role, its layout, icon, and a lot more.

class Form1(Form1Template):

  def __init__(self, **properties):

    # Set Form properties and Data Bindings.

    self.init_components(**properties)



    # Any code you write here will run before the form opens.
    
this is the front end code that allows us to change stuff in the propertys stuff, as mentioned above.

to change propertys in anvil we can for example, go to coding tab, and then do self.variable_name.text = 'our new name'
which then changes the name of the thing we wanna alter.

back end of code: code that allows the website to be running

front end code: what the user will see.

data tab: allows us to store users, or just in general data that we will have

Adming page of website will rendrer all other pages in the website
